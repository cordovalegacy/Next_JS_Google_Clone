// ! The gist of why searchParams works without directly prop passing... (because of NEXTJS13 routing)
//The searchParams object is indirectly provided to the WebSearch component through the usage of the useSearchParams hook in the SearchNav component.
// In the SearchNav component, the useSearchParams hook is used to obtain the current search parameters from the URL query string. The searchParams 
//object is then derived from the useSearchParams hook by calling the get method with the parameter name, "searchTerm". This allows the searchTerm 
//value from the URL query string to be extracted and stored in the searchParams object.Since the WebSearch component is rendered within the SearchNav 
//component, the searchParams object is accessible within the scope of the WebSearch component. This is due to JavaScript's lexical scoping, where 
//variables declared in an outer scope (such as the SearchNav component) are accessible within the inner scope (such as the WebSearch component) 
//unless shadowed by a variable with the same name.Therefore, in the WebSearch component, you can directly access the searchParams object without 
//it being passed as a prop because it is available within the lexical scope.In summary, the searchParams object is obtained using the useSearchParams 
//hook in the SearchNav component and is accessible within the WebSearch component due to JavaScript's lexical scoping.
